# AI-Generated Content Detector – Browser Extension

This browser extension analyzes news websites and estimates how much of the content may be generated by AI. It extracts the article text from the current webpage, sends it to a machine-learning model via an API, and displays the returned percentage in a temporary popup.

## How It Works

1. The extension detects when a supported webpage is loaded.
2. It extracts:
   - URL
   - Page title
   - All paragraph text (stored as an array)
3. The extracted data is sent to a Random Forest–based AI detection model.
4. The model returns a percentage indicating AI-generated likelihood.
5. A popup appears on the screen for 10 seconds displaying the result.

## API Request Format

The extension sends a POST request similar to:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/news",
  "title": "Example Article Title",
  "paragraphs": [
    "Paragraph text here...",
    "More text here..."
  ]
}
```

## API Response Format

```json
{
  "ai_percentage": 57.3
}
```

## Permissions
